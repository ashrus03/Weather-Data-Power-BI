A modern, responsive weather dashboard built with an intuitive UI to display real-time weather updates, forecasts, and air quality insights for different cities. The dashboard provides:
1. Current temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and UV index
2. 7-day weather forecast with sunrise and sunset times
3. Air quality overview with pollutant breakdown (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, CO, O3, NO2)
4. Chances of rain visualization for upcoming days
Designed with clean data visualization and an interactive interface, this project helps users easily track weather conditions and environmental quality.
